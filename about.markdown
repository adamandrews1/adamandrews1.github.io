<p>My name is Adam Andrews. I was born in South Orange County.</p>
<p>I went to UCLA to study Bioengineering and later went on to complete a Master's Degree at Berkeley in the same field. </p>
<p>I started this blog to create something for the world and for myself. I hope to be able to help people with it. </p>
